# Database Backup & Recovery Guide

**How to backup and restore your `database.db` file to prevent data loss!**

---

## 📝 Note About Server Backups (Version 1.3+)

**This guide is for DASHBOARD backups** (your `database.db` file).

**For GAME SERVER backups**, use the new Backup System feature:
1. Go to any server → Click "📊 Live Stats"
2. Scroll down to "Backup System" section
3. Click "Create Backup" to backup your game server files

The Backup System in v1.3 lets users backup their game servers directly from the dashboard!

## ⚠️ Why Backups Are Important

Your `database.db` file contains **ALL** your dashboard data:
- User accounts and passwords
- Server configurations
- Coins and purchases
- Linkvertise links and completions
- Admin settings and configurations
- Pterodactyl panel settings

**If this file is lost or corrupted, you lose everything!** Always keep backups!

## 📦 How to Create Backups

### Manual Backup (One-Time)

**Step 1: Connect to your VPS via SSH**

**Step 2: Go to your dashboard folder:**
```bash
cd AETHER_DASHBOARD
```

**Step 3: Create a backup folder (if it doesn't exist):**
```bash
mkdir -p backups
```

**Step 4: Create a backup:**
```bash
cp database.db backups/database-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a copy of your database file
- Names it with the current date and time (e.g., `database-20240105-143045.db`)
- Stores it in the `backups/` folder

**✅ Backup created!** You can see it with:
```bash
ls -la backups/
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Backups (Recommended)

**Set up automatic daily backups so you never forget!**

### Option 1: Using Cron (Linux)

**Step 1: Open the crontab editor:**
```bash
crontab -e
```

**Step 2: Add this line at the end of the file:**
```bash
# Backup database daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /root/AETHER_DASHBOARD && mkdir -p backups && cp database.db backups/database-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d-\%H\%M\%S).db && find backups/ -name "database-*.db" -mtime +7 -delete
```

**Replace `/root/AETHER_DASHBOARD` with your actual dashboard path!**

**What this does:**
- Runs every day at 2 AM
- Creates a backup with timestamp
- Keeps only the last 7 days of backups (deletes older ones)
- Saves disk space automatically

**Step 3: Save and exit:**
- Press `Ctrl + X`
- Press `Y` to confirm
- Press `Enter`

**✅ Automatic backups are now set up!**

### Option 2: Manual Script

**Create a backup script:**

**Step 1: Create the script file:**
```bash
nano backup-database.sh
```

**Step 2: Paste this content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Database backup script for Aether Dashboard

# Change to dashboard directory
cd /root/AETHER_DASHBOARD

# Create backups folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p backups

# Create backup with timestamp
cp database.db backups/database-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db

# Keep only last 7 days of backups
find backups/ -name "database-*.db" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "✅ Backup created successfully!"
```

**Replace `/root/AETHER_DASHBOARD` with your actual dashboard path!**

**Step 3: Make it executable:**
```bash
chmod +x backup-database.sh
```

**Step 4: Run it manually whenever you want:**
```bash
./backup-database.sh
```

**Or add it to cron for automatic backups:**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add this line:
0 2 * * * /root/AETHER_DASHBOARD/backup-database.sh
```

## 🔍 How to List Your Backups

**See all your backups:**
```bash
cd AETHER_DASHBOARD
ls -lh backups/
```

**This shows:**
- All backup files
- Their sizes
- Creation dates

**Example output:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.2M Jan  5 14:30 database-20240105-143045.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.3M Jan  6 14:30 database-20240106-143045.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.4M Jan  7 14:30 database-20240107-143045.db
```

## 🔄 How to Restore from Backup

**If you accidentally deleted `database.db` or need to restore old data:**

### Step 1: Stop the Dashboard

**Stop the dashboard first:**
```bash
pm2 stop aether-dashboard
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always stop the dashboard before restoring!

### Step 2: List Your Backups

**See what backups you have:**
```bash
cd AETHER_DASHBOARD
ls -la backups/
```

**Find the backup you want to restore** (usually the most recent one)

### Step 3: Restore the Backup

**Copy the backup back to the main location:**
```bash
cp backups/database-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db database.db
```

**Replace `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` with your backup filename!**

**Example:**
```bash
cp backups/database-20240107-143045.db database.db
```

### Step 4: Set Correct Permissions

**Make sure the file has correct permissions:**
```bash
chmod 644 database.db
```

### Step 5: Restart the Dashboard

**Start the dashboard again:**
```bash
pm2 restart aether-dashboard
```

### Step 6: Verify Everything Works

**Check the logs:**
```bash
pm2 logs aether-dashboard --lines 20
```

**Log in to your dashboard** and verify:
- ✅ All users are there
- ✅ All servers are there
- ✅ Settings are correct
- ✅ Coins and purchases are intact

**✅ Data restored successfully!**

## 🚨 What If I Don't Have a Backup?

**If you deleted `database.db` and don't have a backup:**

### The Bad News:
- ❌ **All data is lost** (users, servers, coins, settings)
- ❌ **Cannot recover** without a backup

### The Good News:
- ✅ **Dashboard will recreate itself** automatically
- ✅ **You can start fresh** with default settings

### What to Do:

**Step 1: Restart the dashboard:**
```bash
pm2 restart aether-dashboard
```

**Step 2: The database will be recreated automatically:**
- New empty `database.db` file
- All tables created (empty)
- Default admin user created:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`

**Step 3: Start over:**
- Log in with default admin credentials
- Reconfigure everything:
  - Linkvertise settings
  - Resource prices
  - Pterodactyl connection
  - Branding settings
- Users need to sign up again

**⚠️ This is why backups are so important!**

## 📋 Backup Best Practices

### 1. **Backup Frequency**
- **Daily backups** - Recommended for production
- **Before updates** - Always backup before updating
- **Before major changes** - Backup before making big changes

### 2. **Backup Storage**
- **Keep backups on the server** - Quick access
- **Download backups** - Keep copies on your computer too
- **Multiple locations** - Don't keep all backups in one place

### 3. **Backup Retention**
- **Keep last 7 days** - Daily backups
- **Keep weekly backups** - For longer retention
- **Keep monthly backups** - For long-term recovery

### 4. **Test Your Backups**
- **Test restore** - Periodically test restoring from backup
- **Verify data** - Make sure backups contain correct data
- **Check file size** - Ensure backups aren't corrupted

### 5. **Backup Both Files**
- **`database.db`** - Your data
- **`.env`** - Your configuration

**Backup both together:**
```bash
mkdir -p backups
cp database.db backups/database-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db
cp .env backups/.env-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

## 🔧 Advanced: Download Backups to Your Computer

**Keep backups on your computer for extra safety:**

### Using SFTP (FileZilla)

**Step 1: Connect to your VPS with FileZilla**

**Step 2: Navigate to:**
- Remote: `/root/AETHER_DASHBOARD/backups/`
- Local: Your computer's backup folder

**Step 3: Download backup files:**
- Right-click on backup file
- Select "Download"
- Save to your computer

### Using SCP (Command Line)

**From your computer:**
```bash
scp username@your-vps-ip:/root/AETHER_DASHBOARD/backups/database-*.db /path/to/local/backups/
```

**Replace:**
- `username` with your VPS username
- `your-vps-ip` with your VPS IP address
- `/path/to/local/backups/` with where you want to save on your computer

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when creating backup

**Fix:**
```bash
chmod 755 backups/
chmod 644 database.db
```

### "No space left on device"

**Fix:**
- Delete old backups: `find backups/ -name "database-*.db" -mtime +7 -delete`
- Check disk space: `df -h`
- Clean up old files

### "Backup file is 0 bytes"

**Problem:** Database file might be locked or corrupted

**Fix:**
1. Stop dashboard: `pm2 stop aether-dashboard`
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Try backup again: `cp database.db backups/database-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db`
4. Restart dashboard: `pm2 restart aether-dashboard`

### "Cannot restore backup - file not found"

**Check:**
1. Are you in the right folder? `pwd` should show `/root/AETHER_DASHBOARD`
2. List backups: `ls -la backups/`
3. Check filename spelling (case-sensitive!)
